deepNetwork.py: load the MNIST dataset, train and evaluate on both training set and test set for epochs. save the model to the csv file
loadedNetwork.py: load the model built and evaluate it on the first 10 examples of test set
handWriteTest.py: evaluate the loaded model on hand write digis
examineNetwork.py: build a submodel from loaded model, and find out how are the images processed during network
embeddingSpace.py: project the data into embedding space and calculate the distances in the embedding space
deepNetworkDesign.py: design a network according to various dimensions
GaborNetwork.py: evaluate the network that the conv1 layer is replaced by 10 Gabor filters
model.pt/ optimizer.pt: the info of the regular network
ex_model.pt/ ex_optimizer.pt: the info of the network with Gabor filters added

Operating system: Windows 11
IDE: pycharm

The parameters and potential dimensions can be changed at the top of each program
All outcomes will be printed at the console.

I'd like to use 2 time travel days
